# resource-availability

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks required to calculate the Self-Sufficiency Index (SSI), International Trade Resilience Index (ITRI), and the overall Resource Availability Index (RAI).

**Contents**

Self-Sufficiency Index Calculation (SSIModeling.ipynb): This notebook covers the final computation of SSI for each country.

Self-Sufficiency Index Data Cleaning (SSI-DataCleaning.ipynb): Key steps include data acquisition, cleaning, and transformations

International Trade Resilience Index & Resource Availability Index Calculation (RAIModelling.ipynb): This notebook delves into the formulation of the ITRI, using various global metrics and their respective weights. Furthermore, it combines the SSI and ITRI to yield the RAI for each country. This comprehensive index aids in understanding a country's resilience and availability of resources, especially under challenging scenarios like a nuclear winter.
